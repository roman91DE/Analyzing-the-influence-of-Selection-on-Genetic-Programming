# Introduction


# Research Question

* Does the usage of $\epsilon$-lexicase parent selection influence the generalization behaviour of genetic programming in symbolic regression if compared to tournament selection?

## Genetic Programming 

* A metaheuristic that searches for computer programs that solve a given problem
* Inventor: John R. Koza ^[@koza_main]
* Evolutionary algorithm that simulates the process of Darwinian evolution:
  1. Population based
  2. The quality of solutions is evaluated by a fitness function
  3. Selection: Solutions are selected based on their individual fitness
  4. Variation: Mutation and recombination of solutions
* Unique Features:
  * Evolve solutions of variable length and structure
  * Solutions are typically represented by recursive tree structures


## Parent Selection

* Operator that selects individual solutions from the population for reproduction and mutation
* Most commonly used selection operator in GP: Tournament selection^[@10.1007/978-3-642-16493-4_19, p.181]
* Intuition: High chance for "generalist" solutions to be selected since it is based on aggregated fitness scores

## epsilon-Lexicase Selection

* Recent alternative: Lexicase Selection and it's variation $\epsilon$-lexicase selection
* Idea: Selection method for uncompromising, continous-valued symbolic regression problems ^[@6920034, p.12]
* Increases genetic diversity inside the population^[@6920034, p.1]
* Higher chance for "specialist" solutions to be selected since it is decided on a per case basis
* Performance increases have been demosntrated in many benchmarking problems ^[@epsilon_lexicase_main, p.744-745]


## Symbolic Regression

* Task: Find a mathematical model that fits a given set of datapoints
* One of the first applications of Genetic Programming introduced by @koza_main
* GP, even though more time consuming, can
