# Introduction


## Research Question

* Does the usage of $\epsilon$-lexicase parent selection influence the generalization behaviour of genetic programming in symbolic regression if compared to tournament selection?


## Genetic Programming

* A metaheuristic that searches for computer programs that solve a given problem
* Evolutionary algorithm that simulates the process of Darwinian evolution:
  1. Fitnessfunction: Evaluates the quality of a solution
  1. Selection: Solutions are selected based on their individual fitness
  2. Variation: Mutation and recombination of solutions
* Unique Features:
  * Evolve solutions of variable length and structure
  * Solutions are typically represented by recursive tree structures
